Key Points

    Research suggests KYC features in applications are used by users to verify identity, typically during account setup or for accessing restricted features.
    It seems likely that users provide personal information and upload identification documents through the app's interface.
    The evidence leans toward the process involving steps like taking selfies, video calls, or waiting for verification, with variations based on the app and regulations.

What Are KYC Features?
KYC, or Know Your Customer, is a process used in applications, especially financial ones like banking or cryptocurrency exchanges, to verify a user's identity. This helps prevent fraud and ensures compliance with regulations.
How Users Interact with KYC Features
When using an app, users typically start the KYC process by navigating to a "Verify Identity" section, often during signup or when accessing features like trading or large transactions. They then:

    Enter personal details like name, date of birth, and address.
    Upload identification documents, such as a driver's license or passport, using the app's camera or gallery.
    May need to take a selfie or join a video call for additional verification.
    Wait for the app to process the information, receiving a notification once verified.

Unexpected Detail: Different Verification Levels
Some apps offer multiple KYC levels, like basic for limited access and advanced for higher transaction limits, which users can choose based on their needs.
Comprehensive Analysis of How KYC Features Are Normally Used in Applications by Users
The question of how Know Your Customer (KYC) features are normally used in applications by users is rooted in the broader context of identity verification processes within digital platforms, particularly in financial and banking sectors. This analysis, as of 03:12 AM EAT on Sunday, March 30, 2025, explores the typical user interactions with KYC features, drawing from extensive research and industry insights. It aims to provide a detailed understanding for both technical and non-technical audiences, highlighting the steps, variations, and implications of KYC processes in applications.
Background and Overview
KYC, or Know Your Customer, is a regulatory requirement for financial institutions and increasingly for digital applications to verify the identity of their customers. This process is crucial for preventing fraud, money laundering, and ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. In the context of applications, especially mobile and web-based platforms, KYC features are integrated to facilitate user onboarding and access to sensitive features, such as trading cryptocurrencies, opening bank accounts, or making large transactions. Research suggests that KYC is particularly prevalent in banking apps, investment platforms, cryptocurrency exchanges, and even some social media or e-commerce sites requiring age or identity verification.
The evidence leans toward users interacting with KYC features primarily during account setup or when attempting to unlock restricted functionalities. This interaction involves providing personal information and identification documents through the application's interface, with variations based on the platform and regulatory requirements. Sources like How to Reduce KYC Abandonment in 3 Steps and KYC Process: The Complete Guide highlight the importance of user experience in reducing abandonment, emphasizing clear instructions and preparation.
Typical User Interaction with KYC Features
The process of using KYC features in applications typically follows a structured flow, as outlined in various guides, such as Step-by-Step Guide to Completing the KYC Process in Banking | ICICI Bank. The steps include:

    Accessing the KYC Section: Users begin by navigating to the KYC verification section within the application. This is often triggered during account creation or when attempting to access features that require identity confirmation, such as trading on a cryptocurrency exchange or opening a bank account. For example, in apps like Coinbase, users might see a "Verify Identity" button, as inferred from general knowledge of such platforms.
    Providing Personal Information: Users are prompted to enter personal details, which typically include full name, date of birth, address, and identification number (e.g., social security number, national ID, or PAN number in India, as per KYC Process - Know About Online & Offline KYC Process | India Infoline (IIFL)). This step aims to collect basic information for initial verification, as noted in What is KYC? Overview & short explanations - IDnow.
    Uploading Identification Documents: Following personal information entry, users are required to upload copies of government-issued identification documents to verify their identity. Common documents include a driver's license, passport, or utility bill for proof of address. The application often provides a camera feature to take a picture of the document directly or allows uploading from the device's gallery. This is a critical step, as highlighted in KYC: 3 steps to effective Know Your Customer compliance, where document submission is part of customer identification.
    Additional Verification Steps: Some applications may require further verification methods to ensure the user's identity matches the provided documents. This can include taking a selfie to compare with the ID photo, participating in a video call for live verification, or answering security questions. For instance, Step-by-Step Guide to Completing the KYC Process in Banking | ICICI Bank mentions an online Video KYC option, where users connect via video call with a bank officer to verify documents and record signatures, requiring a reliable internet connection and specific details like PAN number and Aadhaar OTP.
    Waiting for Verification: After submitting the information and documents, users typically wait for the application to process and verify their identity. This can be done automatically using AI technology for instant feedback or manually by the company's staff, which might take from a few minutes to a few days, depending on the platform's policies. Users are often notified of the verification status, with some apps providing a progress tracker or status indicator, as inferred from user experience best practices.
    Receiving Confirmation: Once the verification is complete and successful, users receive a notification or confirmation that their account is fully verified, allowing access to all features or proceeding with transactions. If there are issues, such as incomplete or invalid documents, the app might notify the user to resubmit or provide additional information, as mentioned in How to Build Your Own KYC from Scratch, which discusses initial audits and backend identity verification.

Variations and Additional Features
An unexpected detail is the existence of different levels of KYC verification within some applications, offering flexibility based on user needs. For example, in cryptocurrency exchanges, basic verification might allow limited trading, while full verification is required for higher transaction limits, as inferred from general knowledge of platforms like Coinbase. This multi-tiered approach is not universally mentioned but can enhance user experience by providing incremental access.
Additionally, some apps may use biometric verification, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, as part of the KYC process, particularly for matching selfies with ID photos, which is a form of biometric identity confirmation. This is more common in mobile applications for added security, as noted in KYC: 3 steps to effective Know Your Customer compliance, which mentions leveraging biometrics for better identity verification.
Another variation is the use of knowledge-based questions, such as "What's your mother's maiden name?" for additional identity confirmation, though this is less common and more aligned with account recovery than standard KYC, as per general understanding. The process can also differ based on regulatory requirements, with some regions like India having specific processes like Aadhaar e-KYC, involving biometric or OTP-based verification, as per KYC Process - Know About Online & Offline KYC Process | India Infoline (IIFL).
User Experience and Challenges
Research suggests that user experience is critical to reducing KYC abandonment, with How to Reduce KYC Abandonment in 3 Steps recommending a pre-checklist of requirements, such as ensuring documents are ready and providing clear instructions. Common challenges include users not having documents at hand, leading to multiple sessions to complete KYC, and potential technical issues like poor internet connectivity for video KYC, as mentioned in the ICICI Bank guide.
To illustrate the variations, consider the following table comparing typical KYC processes across different application types:
