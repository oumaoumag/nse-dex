## Project Summary: Tajiri App (New Version)

### Overview
The new Tajiri app is envisioned as a cutting-edge, blockchain-based financial platform designed to tokenize and trade stocks from the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), with a mission to democratize wealth creation in Africa. Deployed on the Hedera blockchain, this app will leverage stablecoins for transactions, incorporate account abstraction for user-friendliness, and feature a modern Next.js frontend. Inspired by leading platforms like Hisa, NSE, Binance, TradingView, Dosikaa, Ndovu, and Pesabits, Tajiri aims to offer advanced trading, lending, and market analysis tools tailored to both novice and experienced investors.

### Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
1. **Enable Advanced Financial Services**: Provide a robust suite of features including trading, lending, and portfolio management, inspired by top-tier financial platforms.
2. **Leverage Hedera Blockchain**: Utilize Hedera’s high-performance, low-cost infrastructure for scalability and efficiency.
3. **Prioritize User Accessibility**: Implement account abstraction to simplify blockchain interactions, making the app intuitive for all users.
4. **Support Stablecoin Transactions**: Allow buying and trading of tokenized stocks with stablecoins (e.g., USDC, USDT) for price stability.
5. **Deliver a Modern Frontend**: Build a responsive, scalable, and SEO-friendly interface using Next.js.
6. **Ensure Compliance and Education**: Integrate regulatory tools (e.g., KYC/AML) and educational resources to meet regional standards and onboard new users effectively.

## Detailed Goals and Features

### 1. Deployment on Hedera Blockchain
**Objective**: Build the app on Hedera Hashgraph to achieve high throughput, low fees, and enterprise-grade reliability.

- **Why Hedera?**
  - **Performance**: Supports up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with finality in under 3 seconds.
  - **Cost Efficiency**: Fixed fees ranging from $0.0001 to $0.01 per transaction.
  - **Tokenization**: Hedera Token Service (HTS) enables seamless creation and management of fungible tokens (e.g., stocks, stablecoins).
  - **Sustainability**: Carbon-negative, enhancing eco-friendly branding.
  - **Governance**: Backed by the Hedera Council, including NSE (joined October 2024), ensuring regional trust.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Smart Contracts**: Use Solidity with Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS) for trading and lending logic.
  - **Tokenization**: Mint NSE stocks (e.g., Safaricom as `SCOM-HBAR`) and stablecoins via HTS.
  - **Native Currency**: HBAR for minimal transaction fees, abstracted from users.
  - **Tools**: Integrate `@hashgraph/sdk` for blockchain interactions in Node.js and the frontend.

### 2. Stablecoin Trading
**Objective**: Facilitate stock purchases and trades using stablecoins to ensure price stability and ease of use.

- **Features**:
  - **Supported Stablecoins**: USDC and USDT, natively minted or bridged to Hedera.
  - **Stock Minting**: Users pay stablecoins to create tokenized stocks (e.g., 1 USDC mints 1 SCOM-HBAR equivalent).
  - **P2P Trading**: Enable peer-to-peer trades via escrow smart contracts, transferring stablecoins between parties.
  - **Redemption**: Allow users to burn stock tokens for stablecoins or HBAR payouts.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - Develop smart contracts to handle stablecoin transfers using HTS APIs (e.g., `TransferTransaction`).
  - Ensure wallet compatibility (e.g., HashPack) for token association and management.

### 3. Account Abstraction
**Objective**: Enhance user experience by abstracting complex blockchain operations, making the app accessible to non-technical users.

- **Features**:
  - **Smart Contract Wallets**: Assign each user a wallet contract to manage assets and execute transactions.
  - **Gas Abstraction**: Enable fee payments in stablecoins (e.g., USDC), with the app handling HBAR costs behind the scenes.
  - **Batch Transactions**: Combine multiple actions (e.g., minting and trading) into a single user operation.
  - **Enhanced Security**: Offer multi-signature or social recovery options for wallet management.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Smart Contract**: Deploy a wallet contract (e.g., `TajiriWallet.sol`) with an `execute` function for transaction execution.
  - **Hedera Adaptation**: Use `ScheduleCreateTransaction` or custom logic to emulate EIP-4337-style abstraction on Hedera.
  - **Frontend**: Provide a seamless UI for wallet creation and transaction signing, eliminating traditional wallet prompts.

### 4. Lending Feature (Inspired by Pesabits)
**Objective**: Introduce a lending protocol where users can borrow against tokenized stocks or lend stablecoins for interest.

- **Features**:
  - **Borrowing**: Lock tokenized stocks (e.g., SCOM-HBAR) as collateral to borrow USDC/USDT (e.g., 50% loan-to-value ratio).
  - **Lending**: Deposit stablecoins into a pool to earn interest from borrowers.
  - **Repayment and Liquidation**: Repay loans with interest to reclaim collateral; un repaid loans trigger liquidation of assets.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Smart Contract**: Create a lending pool contract (e.g., `LendingPool.sol`) with `deposit`, `borrow`, and `repay` functions.
  - **Interest Rates**: Implement fixed (e.g., 5% annualized) or dynamic rates based on market conditions.
  - **Frontend**: Build UI components for depositing, borrowing, and tracking loan status.

### 5. Advanced Features from Referenced Platforms
**Objective**: Integrate sophisticated trading, analytics, and user engagement features inspired by leading platforms.

- **Hisa (https://www.hisa.co/)**
  - **Fractional Investing**: Enable purchases of fractional tokenized stocks (e.g., 0.1 SCOM-HBAR).
  - **Portfolio Tracking**: Offer a real-time dashboard showing asset values and performance metrics.

- **NSE (https://www.nse.co.ke/)**
  - **Market Data**: Provide NSE indices (e.g., NSE All Share Index) and live stock prices.
  - **Bond Trading**: Tokenize and trade government bonds alongside stocks.

- **Binance (https://www.binance.com/en/markets/overview)**

  - **Goal-Based Investing**: Allow users to set financial goals (e.g., “Save for education”) tied to stock investments.
  - **Robo-Advisory**: Suggest diversified portfolios based on user risk profiles.

### 6. Next.js Frontend
**Objective**: Develop a modern, scalable, and responsive user interface using Next.js to enhance user experience and development efficiency.

- **Features**:
  - **App Router**: Utilize Next.js 13+ App Router for dynamic routing and layouts.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Apply utility-first styling for a responsive, visually appealing design.
  - **TypeScript**: Ensure type safety and maintainability in development.
  - **Modular Components**: Create reusable UI elements for the marketplace, wallet, charts, and lending features.
