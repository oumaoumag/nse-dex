# Stock-Collateralized Lending on Tajiri

Tajiri's innovative lending platform introduces a powerful new way to leverage your stock token holdings without selling them. This guide explains how to use Tajiri's lending features to borrow stablecoins against your tokenized stocks.

## Understanding Stock-Collateralized Loans

Stock-collateralized lending on Tajiri allows you to:

- Use your stock tokens as collateral to borrow stablecoins
- Maintain ownership of your stocks while accessing liquidity
- Take advantage of your stock holdings without triggering capital gains taxes
- Access funds quickly without lengthy approval processes

## How Tajiri Lending Works

The Tajiri lending system is built on three key components:

### 1. Smart Contracts
Secure, audited smart contracts manage the entire lending process, from collateral deposit to loan repayment.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Marketplace
Connect directly with lenders who set their terms or borrowers seeking loans.

### 3. Collateral Management
Automated systems monitor collateral ratios and manage liquidations if necessary.

## Getting Started with Lending

To access Tajiri's lending features:

1. Navigate to the **Lending** section from the main dashboard
2. Choose between "Borrow" or "Lend" options
3. Connect your wallet if you haven't already

## Borrowing on Tajiri

### Step 1: Create a Loan Request

1. Select the "Borrow" tab
2. Choose which stock tokens to use as collateral
3. Enter the amount of stablecoins you wish to borrow
4. Review the loan terms:
   - Collateralization ratio (typically 150%)
   - Interest rate
   - Loan duration
5. Submit your loan request

### Step 2: Loan Funding

Once your loan request is live, lenders can review and fund it. Alternatively, you can browse existing lending offers and accept one that meets your needs.

### Step 3: Receiving Funds

When a lender funds your loan:
1. Your collateral is locked in the smart contract
2. The stablecoins are transferred to your wallet
3. You'll receive confirmation of the active loan

### Step 4: Loan Management

During the loan period:
- Monitor your collateral ratio in the "My Loans" section
- Add more collateral if the ratio approaches the liquidation threshold
- Repay part or all of the loan at any time

### Step 5: Loan Completion

When you're ready to close the loan:
1. Navigate to the "My Loans" section
2. Select the loan you wish to repay
3. Click "Repay Loan" and confirm the transaction
4. Your collateral tokens will be returned to your wallet

## Lending on Tajiri

You can also participate as a lender on the platform:

### Creating a Lending Offer

1. Navigate to the "Lend" tab
2. Specify which stablecoins you want to lend
3. Set your terms:
   - Interest rate
   - Loan duration
   - Acceptable collateral tokens
   - Minimum collateralization ratio
4. Post your lending offer

### Managing Active Loans

Once a borrower accepts your offer:
1. Your stablecoins are locked in the smart contract
2. You'll start earning interest immediately
3. Track all your active loans in the "My Loans" section

## Collateralization and Liquidation

### Understanding Collateral Ratios

Tajiri uses a collateralization ratio system to ensure loan security:

| Ratio Status | Description | Action Required |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Healthy (>150%) | Loan is well-collateralized | None |
| Warning (125-150%) | Approaching liquidation threshold | Consider adding collateral |
| Liquidation Risk (<125%) | Risk of automatic liquidation | Add collateral immediately |

### Liquidation Process

If a loan's collateral ratio falls below the minimum threshold:

1. The borrower receives notifications to add collateral
2. If no action is taken, a partial liquidation occurs to restore the minimum ratio
3. Liquidation is performed through a fair market price oracle
4. Any remaining collateral after debt settlement is returned to the borrower

## Lending Strategies

### For Borrowers

- **Short-term Liquidity**: Borrow against your stocks for temporary cash needs without selling
- **Market Opportunities**: Access funds for new investments while maintaining your stock position
- **Emergency Funds**: Create a safety net without disrupting your investment strategy

### For Lenders

- **Passive Income**: Earn interest on your stablecoin holdings
- **Risk Management**: Set your own terms and collateral requirements
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Add crypto-backed loans to your investment mix

## Fees and Rates

Tajiri maintains a transparent fee structure for lending:

- **Platform Fee**: 0.3% of loan amount
- **Interest Rates**: Set by lenders, typically ranging from 4-15% APR
- **Early Repayment**: No penalties for repaying loans before maturity

## Security Considerations

Tajiri prioritizes security in its lending platform:

- **Smart Contract Audits**: All lending contracts undergo rigorous third-party audits
- **Collateral Security**: Assets are held in non-custodial smart contracts
- **Price Oracles**: Multiple oracles ensure accurate collateral valuation
- **Insurance Fund**: Protection against extreme market volatility

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I repay my loan early?
Yes, you can repay your loan partially or in full at any time with no penalties.

### What stock tokens can I use as collateral?
All stock tokens available on the Tajiri platform can be used as collateral, including SAFCOM, EQTY, KCB, and others.
